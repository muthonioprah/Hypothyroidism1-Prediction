# Hypothyroidism1-Prediction
Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems.

Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — impact your health.

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Metric for success: A model with an accuracy level greater than 85%
